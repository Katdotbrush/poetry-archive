    <h3 id="poem-heading">I. DARK NIGHT</h3>
    <p class="poem">The dark night comes in.<br>I was standing at the front of a café; looking from far away the rain.<br>I started walking, but not knowing to where — just looking to redeem.<br>Therefore though, the only think I could feel at that moment was:<br>Uncertainty, wandering in a world without hospitality but hostility.</p>

    <h3 id="poem-heading">II. BUSINESSMAN</h3>
    <p class="poem">
        The bussinessman walked on the narrow streets.<br>His body shook of fear; from head to feet.<br>His heart though, brave was — not giving a chance to getting out of the beat.<br>With clothes that were fit, just commonly Monday sweating.<br>What was it? — He didn't know.<br>But one thing though told him that he wasn't coward.<br>But, walking with the flow.

    <h3 id="poem-heading">III. SWINGING MY SWORD</h3>
    <p class="poem">
        That's like those mercenaries on the dark alleys.<br>Turning quick their eyes and moving their hands over weird ways.<br>Swinging their sword, Japanese style.<br>Nose feeling smells in over a mile.<br>Not indentifying their face.<br>And when the foes rush in! They swing the sword, in pure chase.<br>And to the foes, tell them I'm the pure ace!<br>
    </p>

    <h3 id="poem-heading">IV. THE OLD FIELDMAN</h3>
    <p class="poem">
        Over a green hill, there was an old fieldman.<br>He sat over the armchair; at the front of the cottage house.<br>With his tired eyes, he saw the pasture ran.<br>Smoking a pipe, gentle ember.<br>Knowing that, at the end of the sunset — he would become obscure<br>And none of his partners, to him wouldn't remember.<br>And such pain, the fieldman would endure.
